## The problem
I needed a quick URL shortener and I wanted to do something open source. @kentcdodds did a really great video which inspired me. Ultimately his approach was more maximalist than I needed.
In his video he mentioned @CarlRosell's much more minimalist approach.
I forked this from @CarlRosell.

This is a great way to get a URL shortener on your own domain quick and relatiavely easy to use.

## This solution

This relies on [Netlify's](https://www.netlify.com)
[`_redirects`](https://www.netlify.com/docs/redirects/) file for building a
super simple URL shortener where the URLs are managed on GitHub and Netlify
handles the redirecting for you.
